Tests for brmspy.binaries.r module (R package operations).

Focus: R package lifecycle, error handling, and GitHub token forwarding.

Note: these can be tested with actual R installations across
different OSes. Real R package operations, token forwarding, and error scenarios
will be exercised naturally.
